# Decision log

## Design interview (2026-10-23)

| # | Topic | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Backends | PostgreSQL only; 18 only |
| 2 | Runtime | An owned driver on a Rust library, which is tokio-postgres |
| 3 | Sync/async | Async only |
| 4 | Types | An explicit `query[T]` verified by the checker; no codegen, no plugin |
| 5 | Nullability | SQLx's model with rowx's own corrected walker; unknown counts as nullable; `!`/`?` overrides |
| 6 | Param checking | Static, best effort, sqlty-style |
| 7 | Dynamic SQL | Static only in `query`; `query_unchecked` is the escape hatch |
| 8 | Row types | Tuples and scalars only |
| 9 | Checker split | Python front-end with the Rust core doing DB work |
| 10 | Offline | None; a live DB is required |
| 11 | Diagnostics | Errors only, no fix |
| 12 | Methods | `fetch_one` (raises), `fetch_all`, `execute` |
| 13 | No T | `T = None`; only `execute` |
| 14 | Runtime scope | A single connection only |
| 15 | Migrations | Out of scope |
| 16 | Type map | asyncpg-like |
| 17 | Strictness | Exact match |
| 18 | Uncheckable queries | An error unless written as `query_unchecked` |
| 19 | T sources | Inline, or project aliases |
| 20 | Runtime validation | Arity plus NULL checks |
| 21 | sqlparser-rs | Not in v1 |
| 22 | Concurrency | One operation per connection; raise `ConnectionBusyError` |
| 23 | TLS | rustls |
| 24 | Packaging | One wheel and one CLI |
| 25 | Doc shape | Spec plus milestones and tasks |

## Review-driven decisions (revision 2)

| # | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | `rowx-pg` is pure Rust; all PyObject work is in `rowx-py` | Keeps `cargo test` real and the boundary clean |
| R2 | Cancellation uses a Settling state, rowx's own CancelRequest read to EOF, and draining | Stale cancels killed 55% of follow-up queries |
| R3 | Base nullability checks `convalidated` and `relkind` | PG18 `NOT VALID` NOT NULL, foreign tables |
| R4 | The walker covers scan boundaries, grouping sets, RETURNING old/new, and every matching position | Five unsafe NOT NULL answers were measured |
| R5 | DSN pre-parse with custom rustls verifiers and the ring provider | tokio-postgres rejects `verify-*` and `sslrootcert` |
| R6 | Codec dispatch goes through tokio-postgres `Type`/`Kind` | Domains and arrays carry domain OIDs in params and elements |
| R7 | The encoder and checker share `accepted_params`; `text` accepts only `str`; no `str()` fallback; `str`→`date` is rejected | Otherwise parameter checking would be silently off for text |
| R8 | Retry-once is refined (routine match, 25P02 and 26000 handling) | Retries inside transactions fail |
| R9 | EXPLAIN runs over `simple_query`, only after Parse | The extended protocol demands values for `$n` |
| R10 | The safety wording admits plan-time function evaluation and adds `lock_timeout` | Accuracy |
| R11 | `Any`/`object` are nullability-neutral in both the checker and the runtime | The checker and runtime contradicted each other |
| R12 | `void` columns are treated as 0 columns, or match the tuple element `None` | `SELECT pg_sleep()` could not be satisfied |
| R13 | New rules: `param-count-mismatch`, `indirect-query`, `syntax-error`, `invalid-override` | Silent holes in "uncheckable queries are an error" |
| R14 | A normative source-map algorithm (`tokenize` + verification) | `ast` offsets are bytes and include escapes and seams |
| R15 | Compile eagerly with `TypeError`; fetch-time row-plan errors raise `InterfaceError` | Removes the class contradiction |
| R16 | One row-type grammar with a conformance test | Prevents the runtime and checker drifting apart |
| R17 | The adjacency rule inserts spaces around `$n` | `x{y}` would become the identifier `x$1` |
| R18 | Arity is checked against the statement before executing | Otherwise an empty result hides a shape mismatch |
| R19 | No `NoReturn` overloads | `query[Any]` would be typed `NoReturn` |
| R20 | macOS CI runs without the DB | Docker isn't available on macOS CI runners |
